# Manipulating Floats in a Text File
This simple Python script reads a file named "textFile.txt" which contains a mix of strings and floats, multiplies each float by 2 and replaces it with the result of multiplication. The script stores the result in a new file named "newTextFile.txt"

### Contents of "textFile.txt"
```bash
5.7,2.9,1.4,0.2,line1
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,line2
15.0,3.2,4.5,4.4,line3
1.4,1.2,4.5,1.5,line4
6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,line5
9.4,2.7,3.1,0.3,line6
```
### Contents of Resulting File "newTextFile.txt" Should be:
```bash
11.4,5.8,2.8,0.4,line1
9.8,6.0,2.8,0.4,line2
30.0,6.4,9.0,8.8,line3
2.8,2.4,9.0,3.0,line4
12.6,6.6,12.0,5.0,line5
